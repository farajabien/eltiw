## 🔄 **PHASE 4: SLUG STORE ARCHITECTURE REFACTOR** ✅

### 🎯 **The Problem: Overcomplicated Architecture**
Currently using Slug Store as just "URL state" when it's designed to be **both state management AND database replacement**.

### ✅ **Refactor Goals**
- [x] **Eliminate Redundant State Management**
  - [x] Remove `useGoalsStore.ts` (localStorage-based)
  - [x] Remove `useGoalCalculations.ts` (separate hook)
  - [x] Consolidate all state into Slug Store
  - [x] Use Slug Store's built-in state management capabilities

- [x] **Leverage Slug Store's Full Power**
  - [x] Use `create()` function for Zustand-like global state
  - [x] Implement proper state selectors and actions
  - [x] Add state validation and migration
  - [x] Enable compression and encryption options

- [x] **Simplify Component Architecture**
  - [x] Remove prop drilling for state
  - [x] Use Slug Store hooks directly in components
  - [x] Implement proper state subscriptions
  - [x] Add state persistence strategies

### 🔧 **New Architecture Implemented**

#### **1. Single Slug Store for Everything**
```typescript
// lib/stores/goalsStore.ts
const useGoalsStore = create((set, get) => ({
  // State
  goals: [],
  filters: { category: 'all', status: 'all' },
  view: 'grid',
  
  // Actions
  addGoal: (goal) => set(state => ({ goals: [goal, ...state.goals] })),
  updateGoal: (id, updates) => set(state => ({
    goals: state.goals.map(g => g.id === id ? { ...g, ...updates } : g)
  })),
  deleteGoal: (id) => set(state => ({
    goals: state.goals.filter(g => g.id !== id)
  })),
  
  // Computed values (no separate calculation hook needed)
  getCompletedGoals: () => get().goals.filter(g => g.isCompleted),
  getTotalSaved: () => get().goals.reduce((sum, g) => sum + g.totalSaved, 0),
  getMonthlySavingsNeeded: () => {
    const goals = get().goals.filter(g => !g.isCompleted)
    return goals.reduce((sum, g) => sum + g.monthlyNeeded, 0)
  }
}), { 
  compress: true,
  debounceMs: 500,
  key: 'goals'
})
```

#### **2. Simplified Component Usage**
```typescript
// components/goals/GoalsManager.tsx
export function GoalsManager() {
  const { goals, addGoal, updateGoal, deleteGoal, getCompletedGoals } = useGoalsStore()
  
  // No more prop drilling, no separate calculation hooks
  // Everything comes from Slug Store
}
```
